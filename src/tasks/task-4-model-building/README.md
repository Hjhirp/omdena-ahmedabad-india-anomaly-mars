### Sub-Task Table

| Sub-Task No| Sub-Task Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
|1|  Prepare for model building readiness |   Image Annotations was done using VIA in COCO format but was required to be converted to YOLO format as YOLOv4 model was selected for this project     |
|2|  Model Architecture/Selection       |  YOLOv4 was selected for this project as part of Transfer Learning - Please refer task-0-knowledge folder for relevant information    |
|3|   Model training and validation     | Image label for Crater,  Dark dune, slope streak, bright dune, impact ejecta, swiss cheese and spider class was used      |
|4|   Model performance evaluation      | Accuracy result were in range of above 90%       |
|5|   Prepare Model for deployment readiness      |  Please refer task-5-model-deployment folder for relevant information      |
