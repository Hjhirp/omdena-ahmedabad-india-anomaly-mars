About this task:

* Researching different pathways to solve the problem and annotate image accordingly

* Exploring different state of the art architectures for object detection

* Comparative analysis of the models explored on the basis of mAP, prediction time, train time, and model architecture to chose the best model given requirements

### Sub-Task Table

| Sub-Task No| Sub-Task Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
|1| Researching suitability of algorithms     | Researching the suitability of object detection and instance segmentation with regards to our dataset |
|2| Annotating images accordingly             | Dataset images annotated by [VIA](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/) in COCO format |
|3| Model Architecture Selection              | YOLOv4 with transfer learning was selected for the problem statement due to less inference time - Please refer [task-0-knowledge](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/omdena-ahmedabad-india-anomaly-mars/tree/main/src/tasks/task-0-knowledge) folder for relevant information |
|4| Prepare data for model building readiness |  The annotations were converted to YOLO format as YOLOv4 model was selected for this project |
|7| Model deployment                         |  Please refer [task-5-model-deployment](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/omdena-ahmedabad-india-anomaly-mars/tree/main/src/tasks/task-5-model-deployment) folder for relevant information |
